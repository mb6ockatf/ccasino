#### Files
 - There is the main code in the main.py file.
 - There are functions in the ctw.py file. 'main.py' uses them.

To start the program you need to run it with a Python interpreter.
Also you can contact me using email: bigproject404@yandex.ru

I'd be glad to get any feedback or development ideas.
