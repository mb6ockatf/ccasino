# playing-the-casino v1.0
 - Creator (developer) does not guarantee you that this program will work and anything like that.
 - This program is being shared only under the Apache 2.0 license.
 - The developer is not guilty if any harm was made using this program and so on.

There is the main code in the main.py file.
There are functions in the ctw.py file. 'main.py' uses them.

To start the program you have to run it with a Python interpreter.
You can write to the developer using email: mdddmmmmm@yandex.ru
You can also look at my account on GitHub: https://github.com/mdddmmmm76

I'd be glad to get any feedback or development ideas.
