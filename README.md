# playing-the-casino

 - My first public repository on github.
 - This program is written using only Python language. It's only the first version, so not a lotof features inside it.
 - It is a casino game.
 - Run main.py to start.
 - ctw.py contains some functions which main.py uses.
 - You can contact me with mdddmmmm@yandex.py or on GitHub.

 - I'm really a beginner, so my code is quite simple. I'd be grateful to you for any ideas about how can i improve it.
