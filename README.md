# playing-the-casino v1.0

This repository is in progress and the code **does not work**.
It is just not finished. Look up in 'releases' for stable versions.

#### Files
 - There is the main code in the main.py file.
 - There are functions in the ctw.py file. 'main.py' uses them.

To start the program you need to run it with a Python interpreter.
You can write to the developer using email: mdddmmmmm@yandex.ru
You can also look at my account on GitHub: https://github.com/mdddmmmm76

I'd be glad to get any feedback or development ideas.
